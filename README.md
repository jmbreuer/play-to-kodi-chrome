# An Extension for Chrome/Chromium-based browsers to cast online content to Kodi for playback

## Work in Progress

This is a fork of https://github.com/khloke/play-to-xbmc-chrome kept working insofar as I personally use it. I'm happy to have a look at further issues as my time and energy allows.

As of November 2021, it works for me using mostly Vivaldi 4.3, Kodi 19.1, casting whatever media I come across.

One reason for me to start this project was to fix sending YouTube Playlists to Kodi, but as of now that functionality appears to be broken on the Kodi side in [plugin.video.youtube](https://github.com/anxdpanic/plugin.video.youtube), and I'm currently no longer actively debugging that [issue](https://github.com/anxdpanic/plugin.video.youtube/issues/115).

## Installation

Download this git project (green "Code" button above, "Download as ZIP"), unpack, and load the resulting directory (`play-to-kodi-master`) as an Extension, see [HowTo](https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-install-the-unpacked-extension-in-chrome/).
